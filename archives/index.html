        <h3>Archives</h3>
        <p>
           The landing for the archives page. This houses the archives and stuff. There will be different sections for jars, texture/resource packs, mods, worlds, etc. There could also be a submission thing for new things that can added to the archive or something. idk definitely discuss that, but if were up to me, it should definitely be done using multiple sources such as Discord and email. I also wonder if there is a way to make links for new files that are added to the server automatically. And while we are on that topic, what tools should we use for that?

                    If you want to add in more socials, you can grab an svg icon
                    from https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&f=brands and then place the downloaded
                    file into assets -> icons folder.

                    Then you can copy one of the code snippets above and place it
                    under this line -->
